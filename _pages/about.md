I am a Power BI developer and mechanical engineer with 4+ years of diverse experience in medical device design and manufacturing.

I developed a passion for data analytics by building automated reports and dashboards in Access and Excel. The purpose of this portfolio is to share examples of work I've done with more powerful tools like Python, R, and SQL.

My primary career interest is in healthcare and improving patient outcomes. For more details on my background in this space please see my resume below:
