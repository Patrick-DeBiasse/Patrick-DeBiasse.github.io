I am a data analyst and mechanical engineer with 4+ years of diverse experience across medical device design and manufacturing.

I discovered a passion for working with data using common programs like Access, Excel, and Minitab. The purpose of this portfolio is to share examples of work I've done with more powerful tools like Python, R, and SQL.

My primary career interest is in healthcare and improving patient outcomes. For more details on my background in this space, see my resume below:
