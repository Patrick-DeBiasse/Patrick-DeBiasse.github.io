I am a fledgling data scientist (formal background in mechanical engineering) with over 4 years of practical experience in design and manufacturing - primarily with consumable medical devices.

Not having a formal background in data science or software development, my hope for this portfolio is to demonstrate my competence with modern data science languages and approaches.
