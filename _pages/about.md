I am a mechanical engineer and aspiring data scientist with 4 years of diverse experience in medical device design and manufacturing.

I discovered a passion for data wrangling and visualization after building some advanced dashboards with  Microsoft Access and Excel. The purpose of this portfolio is to share examples of work I've done using more advanced tools like Python and R.

My primary career interest is in healthcare and improving patient outcomes. For more details on my work in this space, please see my resume below.
